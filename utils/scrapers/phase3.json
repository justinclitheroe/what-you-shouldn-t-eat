Return to the oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the joint between the leg and thigh registers 165 degrees F, approximately 30 minutes longer. When the chicken is done, remove from the pan to a serving platter and allow to rest for 15 minutes before carving and plating.",
        "Meanwhile, make a pan sauce. Place the chicken pan over medium-high heat and add the remaining butter and wine. Stir until the butter is melted and the sauce thickens slightly. Pour the pan sauce over the platter of chicken. Serve immediately."

Once slightly cooled, add the mixture to a large container and add 6 cups ice to yield about 10 cups liquid. Add the pork and submerge. Place into the refrigerator for about 2 to 3 hours.

With a sharp, thin knife, slice carefully along the bones, separating the eye of the loin from the bones, but leaving the loin still attached on the bottom. Continue butterflying and slowly roll out, creating a large flat surface for the pesto to easily spread on.",

Carefully roll back up. Cut a 2 to 3-inch slit in between the bones. Truss the roast with kitchen string in between the bones and around the roast. This will help the roast cook evenly.",

Place the tied pork roast on a v-rack over the vegetables, tent with heavy duty aluminum foil, and roast in the oven until the internal temperature reads 145 to 150 degrees F, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. About 3/4 of the way through the cooking process remove the foil, this will help the pork brown up a bit. Remove from the oven, tent with foil, and let sit for 15 to 20 minutes to rest and carry over cooking for another 5 to 10 degrees F. Place the roasting pan over medium-high heat and add 1 1/2 to 2 cups chicken stock and bring to a boil. Allow to boil and reduce for 5 minutes.",

Pulse 6 or 7 times until the chiles have broken down. Pour into a sieve over a bowl to strain and use the back of a rubber spatula to squeeze out the chile pulp. Stir in the agave nectar. Cool the hot sauce. Use immediately or store in an airtight glass jar or bottle to keep. Makes about 1 cup."

Turn the meat over and cook until browned, 5 to 7 minutes, then transfer to the baking sheet with the chorizo. Add the onions and red bell peppers to the pan and saute until the onions are translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the rice and garlic, and mix well until the rice is coated with oil. Cook until the rice smells nutty, 5 to 6 minutes. Add half of the broth and half of the verde sauce, and stir well to combine. Spread the rice evenly around the pan and return the chicken, pork and chorizo to the pan. Cook until the broth is absorbed, about 10 minutes, then add the remaining 3 cups broth. Once bubbling, cover with foil and transfer to the oven; cook until the rice is al dente, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the foil, dollop the remaining verde sauce over the top and sprinkle with the lime zest and chopped cilantro to serve."

Spoon 1 tablespoon of the filling into the center of each, brush the edges with water to moisten, place a second wonton over top and press to adhere. Use an inverted 2-inch cookie cutter (the smooth side) to gently seal the filling into the middle (this ensures a snug fit and no air bubbles which will make the ravioli burst when poached). Use a 3-inch cookie cutter (the sharp side) to cut out and create round raviolis.",
        "Bring 2 quarts well-salted water to a simmer in a large pot. Working in batches, simmer the ravioli until they are al dente, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.",
        "Meanwhile, make the brown butter sage sauce: Set a large skillet over medium heat. Add the butter and cook, stirring until it melts and becomes foamy. Once the butter turns golden brown and has a nutty aroma, about 3 minutes, add the capers, sage and garlic. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Once the sage is fragrant, remove the skillet from the heat and fold in the parsley, tarragon and lemon juice. Stir to incorporate and warm up the herbs and lemon -- this will release their aroma but they'll maintain their bright vibrant color.",
        "To heat and serve: Working in batches to not overcrowd the pan, gently toss the poached ravioli in the brown butter in a large saute pan for 1 to 2 minutes over medium heat to coat the pasta evenly. Place the ravioli on plates and spoon over sauce from the pan. Top with shaved Parmesan, garnish with basil buds and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil."

        "Conventional cooking method: To make these at home, cook them over a gas burner. Hold the press directly over a medium-high flame and cook for 2 minutes, turning multiple times. The heat is more concentrated, so they cook faster than over a campfire.",
        "You'll need: Campfire, sandwich presses, foil-wrapped bricks",
        "Prep-Ahead Tip: Set the sandwich presses over the fire to heat up as you prepare the sandwiches so they're nice and hot when you're ready for some toasting action.",
        "Camping Sandwich Combos:",
        "Make other pressed sandwiches by stuffing a variety of camping leftovers into the sandwich, such as pulled pork with BBQ sauce; shredded smoked chicken and sliced green chiles; steak and peppers from fajitas; or ground turkey with Jack cheese, fire-roasted tomato salsa, and black beans.",
        "For a breakfast sandwich, try diced roasted potatoes and crumbled chorizo with shredded Cheddar and scrambled eggs.",
        "You can make dessert camping sandwiches as well. Slice them or serve whole: sauteed peaches and sweetened ricotta; peanut butter and strawberries; sliced apples and caramel sauce; roasted pineapple, bananas, and honey; chocolate chunks, marshmallows, and graham cracker crumbs; sliced ripe banana, brown sugar, and Nutella.",
        "Mac-n-Cheese:",
        "Camping sandwiches can be prepared ahead of time and made in either square or circular presses-both work fine. Depending on your make and model, adjust the filling amounts so the sandwiches are full but not too full (or they'll ooze while being toasted). The fillings can vary, and it's a good way to utilize leftover chili, mac-n- cheese, and other ingredients when camping.",
        "For circular sandwiches, punch out the bread into 4-inch circles or the size of your sandwich press.",
        "Prepare a campfire with wood and wait until the flames die down and the coals glow red with white ash. Place a grilling rack so that it sits just above the coals. Place the presses on the grill so they heat up.",
        "Assemble each sandwich with the desired fillings, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges. Remove the presses from the hot grill, open, and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Place a sandwich in each press (it will sizzle-this preheating helps it form a nice crispy crust) and close tightly. Place on the grill and cook for 1 or 2 minutes per side. You can check the sandwich as it cooks by opening the press and checking the color-it should be golden brown and crispy on both sides when done. (Depending on how hot your coals are, you can also place the press directly on coals to make it cook faster-just keep an eye on it!) Be sure to use room temperature (versus cold) ingredients in the filling-otherwise lower the flame and toast the sandwich for a longer amount of time to sufficiently warm the filling."

        "Begin by making the green chile salsa: Place the chiles on a roasting tray with the garlic and onions. Drizzle with olive oil, season with salt, pepper and cumin and then place under the broiler to cook, 5 to 7 minutes. Once the skins have blistered and the onions have slightly charred around the edges, remove from the oven. Let cool slightly, then remove and discard the skins of the large chiles, along with the seeds and stems. Place the chile flesh, onions and garlic in a food processor. Add the lime juice and pulse 5 to 6 times to roughly chop the vegetables up; do not over chop as you want the salsa to be chunky and still have lots of texture where you can see pieces of the chile. Taste and season once more, then set aside as you prepare the burgers.",
        "For the burgers: Preheat an outdoor grill and wipe down the grates with an oil-blotted paper towel. This not only cleans the grill but creates a nonstick surface.",
        "Form the ground brisket into four 8-ounce patties about 1/2-inch thick. Make them slightly bigger in diameter than your buns, as they shrink when they cook. Also, add a dimple in the center as the burger puffs up in the middle when cooked, and this will ensure a flat, even patty. Sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper, and then place on the hot part of the grill. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes on one side, then flip the patties and top with the cheese. Close the grill or place a metal bowl over the top to melt the cheese and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes. Cut open the hamburger buns and lightly toast on the grill.",
        "To assemble, place the lettuce, onion and tomato on the base of the burger bun. Top with a grilled patty and place a heaping spoonful of roasted green chile salsa on top. Smear the top burger bun with mayo, if desired, and place the top half of the burger bun on top. Serve."

Using the flat side of a meat tenderizer, gently pound out each piece of chicken to an even 1/4-inch thickness. Work gently from the center outwards so as to keep it even and not tear the chicken. Repeat with the remaining cutlets.",

In a second shallow bowl, add the buttermilk, season with salt and pepper and mix well. In a third shallow bowl, add the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, season with salt and pepper and mix well.",

Cover evenly on both sides, gently patting the crumbs into the chicken to help it stick. Place the breaded cutlets in a single layer on a platter and place uncovered in the fridge for 15 minutes - this will help the coating stick to the cutlet and prevent tearing when it comes time to cook them.",
        "To cook the cutlets, set 2 large nonstick saute pans, cast-iron pans if available, over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of oil to each and cook 2 cutlets in each pan for 3 to 4 minutes per side. When done, they will be golden brown and crispy. Transfer to an ovenproof pan and keep warm in the oven. Try not to keep the chicken in the oven longer than 15 minutes, otherwise it will dry out.",
        "Now make the gravy: Set a medium saute pan with high sides over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. Add the garlic, onions and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Saute until the onions are lightly caramelized and tender, 7 to 8 minutes. Deglaze with the white wine and reduce for 1 minute before adding the chicken broth. Simmer for 5 to 6 minutes, and then add the cold butter cubes to the sauce. Remove from the heat and swirl the pan to melt the butter evenly - this will thicken the sauce and give it a nice sheen.

Cook over high heat until well browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Turn the chops over and reduce the heat slightly to allow the chops to cook through. Cook on the second side until golden brown, about 8 minutes. When done, remove the pork chops from the skillet and place onto a sheet tray. Divide the slices of the Brie between the chops and layer evenly on each so they are covered well. Place the sheet tray into the oven and cook until the Brie is just melted and the pork has cooked to 140 to 145 degrees F. Remove from the oven and transfer the chops to a plate to rest.",
        "For the pan sauce: Meanwhile, place the skillet back over medium-high heat. Add a drizzle of olive oil and then add the apples and onions. Saute for 4 to 5 minutes, and then add the Calvados. Allow the alcohol to cook off (you can flambe at this stage if desired by igniting the Calvados in the pan). Once the Calvados has reduced, add the stock and simmer. Season with some salt and pepper. Allow to reduce for 2 to 3 minutes, and then remove from the heat and swirl in the cold butter cubes. This will thicken the sauce and give it a nice sheen. Serve the Brie-topped pork chops with the sauce."

        "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cut off the top third of the garlic head to expose the cloves. Place onto a piece of foil. Drizzle with some olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover the garlic with the foil and place into the oven for about 1 hour 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool to the touch. Remove the garlic cloves from their husks. Reserve until ready to use. Mince 1 teaspoon of the roasted garlic and melt with the butter in a small saucepan. Season with salt. Gently warm until the garlic becomes fragrant. Set aside in the fridge to slightly firm up again. Begin by preparing the bacon for the pig patties. Set a large pot of cold water over high heat and add the bacon. Bring to a medium boil and cook until the bacon is very tender and almost falling apart, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Drain and set aside to cool. Set a flat cast-iron grill pan over high heat. Divide the bacon into 4 even portions, form each portion into a patty and place on the grill. Press down with the foil-covered brick to squash the bacon together and into a flat patty so it crisps. Cook until golden and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove and keep warm. Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions (8 ounces each) and form into 4 tight balls. Sprinkle the hamburger \"ball\" all over with salt and pepper. To the griddle pan (which still has some of the bacon fat on it) place the hamburger balls on and flatten with a strong, flat metal spatula. Flatten to approximately 1/3-inch thickness and continue to press down with the spatula as it cooks. Cook until the burgers develop a crust on the first side, 1 1/2 minutes. Flip over and cook on the second side to develop a crust on that side, 1 minute. Add 2 ounces Mornay Sauce, if using, to the top of the hamburger and top with a slice of cheese. Place a dome lid over the top of the burger. Pour the chicken broth mixture on to the flat top so the liquid runs under the dome and creates steam to cook the burger and melt the cheese. When the burger is at desired point of doneness and the cheese is completely melted, remove the dome lid and set the burgers aside. Brush the cut sides of the buns lightly with the garlic butter. Toast the buns on the flat top until golden and crisp, 3 to 4 seconds. Flip and toast the outsides so they are also lightly toasted, 3 to 4 seconds. To assemble: Smear the \"Donkey\" Sauce on the cut side of both bun halves. Layer the base with pickle slices and the hamburger patty. Top with a bacon \"pig patty.\" Top with the onions, tomato and lettuce, and then place the top half of the bun on top. Wrap in waxed parchment paper and serve immediately.",

Cook over low heat until the butter and flour combine into a mixture like wet sand. Once combined, stir for 1 to 2 minutes to cook the flour (but without adding color). Pour in the milk slowly as you whisk to combine. Continue stirring until the mixture thickens up, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the salt, nutmeg and cheese and stir until the cheese has melted and the mixture is smooth. Set aside and keep warm until ready to use. Yield: 1 cup.",

        "For the stock: If you have the time, allow the chicken to drain and dry out about 30 minutes prior to searing. It will create a better crust on the chicken and more brown bits on the bottom of the pot, ultimately adding more flavor to the gumbo.",
        "Sprinkle the chicken pieces, including the reserved neck, back and wing tips, with the salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven (enameled cast iron preferred), heat the oil over high heat until shimmering. Add the chicken pieces and brown well on all sides, turning as needed. Add the celery, carrots, onions and jalapenos, and continue to brown for an additional 10 minutes. Add 1 gallon water and the liquid smoke and bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat to maintain a strong simmer. Cook for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.",

        "For the gumbo: In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, add the sausages and cook until the fat has rendered down, about 5 minutes. Remove the sausages from the pan and set aside. Add the bacon fat and, when shimmering, add the onions, celery, bell peppers and Anaheim peppers. Saute, stirring frequently, until the onions are just starting to color, 10 to 12 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 2 to 3 minutes more, being careful not to let it burn. Add the flour, 1/4 cup at a time, stirring constantly. Stir until a dark golden roux has developed, 11 to 13 minutes. Add 1 cup at a time of the stock, incorporating well after each addition, to total 6 cups.",
        "Add the reserved sausages, shredded chicken, cayenne and white pepper into the pot. Heat through and add the salt and black pepper. If the gumbo is too thick, add a bit more stock to the pot, a little at a time, until the desired consistency is reached.",

Once the sugar mixture has turned a caramel color, remove from the heat and carefully dump in the chopped aromatics; take care as the hot caramel will bubble up and steam.

While the oil is heating up, trim the ends of the plantains and then slice lengthwise into thin (about 1/16-inch thick) planks using a mandoline. In small batches to avoid overcrowding, fry the plantain planks until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Gently move the plantains around in the oil as they fry--this helps them crisp up. Drain on paper towels or a cooling rack set over a baking sheet. Sprinkle the chips immediately with the salt and smoked paprika. Serve with the sweet chile dipping sauce."

Drain on paper towels and season with salt as the plantains come out of the oil.",

Toss to mix. Season with salt and pepper. Scoop out individual portions of mofongo using an ice cream scoop and transfer to shallow bowls. Ladle some of the sopa de pollo over the top or serve it in small bowls on the side. Top the mofongo with some of the shredded pork. Serve."

        "In a glass bowl, add the vinegar, lime juice, lime slices, peppercorns, chile peppers, and whole and minced garlic. Stir in the cooled salt-agave water mixture.",
        "Wash and trim the green beans. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium heat. Stir in the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt, then add the beans. Cook until the beans begin to turn bright green and are just tender, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and drain. Rinse immediately with cold water and put them in an ice bath for 10 minutes. Drain well.",
        "If you are canning, prepare the jar(s) according to processing directions, add the beans and then cover with the vinegar chile pepper mixture. Process in a canning pot for 3 minutes, remove and cool.",
        "You can also put them in sterilized jars and refrigerate instead of doing the canning process. Just keep under refrigeration and eat within 1 month. Whichever method suits you best, allow these to marinate for 48 hours before eating."
