        "Add the bacon grease and butter to a large stockpot over high heat. Add the Anaheim chiles, poblano chiles, red bell peppers, jalapeno chiles and onions, and cook until caramelized, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and saute 1 minute longer. Add the chuck and brown, about 4 minutes. Add the ground beef and sausage and brown, stirring gently, trying not to break up the ground beef too much. Cook until the meat is nicely browned and cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the chili powder, cayenne, coriander, cumin, granulated garlic, granulated onion, paprika, salt and black pepper, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.",

Parcook until the potatoes are light brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the potatoes, gently shaking off the excess oil and let them drain on a rack. Repeat the process until all of the potatoes are parcooked.",
        "Raise the heat of the oil to 350 degrees F. Cook the potatoes again, two handfuls at a time, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove the potatoes from the oil, shake off the excess oil, place in a bowl and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Repeat the process until all of the potatoes are cooked."
